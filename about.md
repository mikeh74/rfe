# About

Radio Free Europe is a personal project for trying new ideas, keeping
project notes, and sharing short experiments about building on the web.

The site is intentionally lightweight. It runs on
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a minimal layout structure and uses
[Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/) for clean, readable styling without a heavy
framework. Content lives in plain markdown, so writing and publishing stays
fast and simple.

I also used GitHub Copilot during setup to speed up scaffolding and styling
while keeping the final copy and structure firmly in my hands.


## Why Radio Free Europe?

The name is a nod to R.E.M.'s "Radio Free Europe," the band's early breakout
single. It is a jangly track that helped define the sound of college rock and
set the tone for the band's early period.

It also references the actual Radio Free Europe, the US-funded broadcaster that
began during the Cold War to provide news and cultural programming to audiences
in Eastern Europe. The station later became part of Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty and continues broadcasting today.

Neither has anything to do with web development.
