# About

Radio Free Europe is a small, personal space for trying new ideas, keeping
project notes, and sharing short experiments about building on the web.

The site is intentionally lightweight. It runs on
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a minimal layout structure and uses
[Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/) for clean, readable styling without a heavy
framework. Content lives in plain markdown, so writing and publishing stays
fast and simple.

I also used GitHub Copilot during setup to speed up scaffolding and styling
while keeping the final copy and structure firmly in my hands.
