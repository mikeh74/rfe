# Welcome to yet another developer blog

This site is a place to try new ideas and keep notes from different projects
in one place.

It is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for content and routing, with
[Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/) providing a lightweight, readable baseline for
the UI. Posts live in the `_posts` folder, layouts are in `_layouts`, and shared
partials (like the header and footer) sit in `_includes`. Sass lives in
`assets/scss`, compiled to `assets/css` for the generated site.

The build is intentionally simple: run the local server, write markdown, and
let Jekyll handle the rest. That means no heavy tooling and a fast feedback
loop while editing.

I also used GitHub Copilot while setting this up. It helped scaffold the posts
index, polish styles, and draft sections like this one. I treat it as a
pair-programming partner: it speeds up the first pass, then I refine the copy
and structure.

If you are reading this, you are seeing the result of basic tools, a simple
build process, and inexpensive hosting working together.
